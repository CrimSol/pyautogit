# Contributing to py_cui

I'll welcome anyone wanting to contribute to the development of `pyautogit`. If you wish to contribute to the core codebase of the library, you may want to take a look at the developers page of the [documentation](https://jwlodek.github.io/pyautogit-docs/). If you have used `pyautogit` for a project, or have any feedback, feel free to let me know.

Before you create a pull request, here are some things to keep in mind:

#### Make sure the unit tests pass

If you make a pull request and Travis tells you a unit test failed, please fix the issue and append to the pull request. I will most likely only look closely at pull requests that don't show any issues with the CI.

#### Use consistent numpy documentation

The documentation building process for `pyautogit` depends on strict numpy-style documenatation. Please be consistent in format with the rest of the project.

#### Use the fork-pull request model

Please use the standard github fork-pull request model for contributions, preferably with creating branch names that reflect the feature or bugfix you are adding. Also, please describe what your pull request is doing when creating it, and if applicable, please add a link to any related issues or pull requests.

#### Check the AUTHORS file

If you'd like, add your name to the `Contributing Authors` section of the `AUTHORS` file. This way your name will appear in the project outside of the github environment.
